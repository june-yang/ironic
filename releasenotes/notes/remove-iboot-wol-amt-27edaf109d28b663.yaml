    iBoot, Wake-On-LAN and AMT drivers are removed from ironic as they
    neither have nor are planning to have a third-party CI.
    They are still available from unsupported ironic driver collection
    in ``ironic-staging-drivers`` repository.
    If the ironic installation was using any driver based on those,
    the operator has to install ``ironic-staging-drivers``
    and change the driver on affected nodes
    according to following correspondence list

    * agent_amt -> pxe_amt_agent
    * pxe_amt -> pxe_amt_iscsi
    * agent_wol -> pxe_wol_agent
    * pxe_wol -> pxe_wol_iscsi
    * agent_iboot -> pxe_iboot_agent
    * pxe_iboot -> pxe_iboot_iscsi
