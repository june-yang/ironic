Enrollment
==========

After all the services have been properly configured, you should enroll your
hardware with the Bare Metal service, and confirm that the Compute service sees
the available hardware. The nodes will be visible to the Compute service once
they are in the ``available`` provision state.

.. note::
   After enrolling nodes with the Bare Metal service, the Compute service
   will not be immediately notified of the new resources. The Compute service's
   resource tracker syncs periodically, and so any changes made directly to the
   Bare Metal service's resources will become visible in the Compute service
   only after the next run of that periodic task.
   More information is in the :ref:`troubleshooting` section.

.. note::
   Any bare metal node that is visible to the Compute service may have a
   workload scheduled to it, if both the ``power`` and ``deploy`` interfaces
   pass the ``validate`` check.
   If you wish to exclude a node from the Compute service's scheduler, for
   instance so that you can perform maintenance on it, you can set the node to
   "maintenance" mode.
   For more information see the :ref:`maintenance_mode` section.

Enrollment process
------------------

This section describes the main steps to enroll a node and make it available
for provisioning. Some steps are shown separately for illustration purposes,
and may be combined if desired.

#. Create a node in the Bare Metal service. At a minimum, you must
   specify the driver name (for example, "pxe_ipmitool").
   This will return the node UUID along with other information
   about the node. The node's provision state will be ``available``. (The
   example assumes that the client is using the default API version.)::

    ironic node-create -d pxe_ipmitool

    | ...                    | ...                                  |
    +------------------------+--------------------------------------+

   Beginning with the Kilo release a node may also be referred to by a logical
   name as well as its UUID. To utilize this new feature a name must be
   assigned to the node. This can be done when the node is created by
   adding the ``-n`` option to the ``node-create`` command or by updating an
   existing node with the ``node-update`` command. See `Logical Names`_ for
   examples.

   Beginning with the Liberty release, with API version 1.11 and above, a newly
   created node will have an initial provision state of ``enroll`` as opposed to
   ``available``. See `Enrolling a node`_ for more details.

#. Update the node ``driver_info`` so that Bare Metal service can manage the
   node. Different drivers may require different information about the node.
   You can determine this with the ``driver-properties`` command, as follows::

    ironic driver-properties pxe_ipmitool
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Property             | Description                                                                                                 |
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ipmi_address         | IP address or hostname of the node. Required.                                                               |
    | ipmi_password        | password. Optional.                                                                                         |
    | ipmi_username        | username; default is NULL user. Optional.                                                                   |
    | ...                  | ...                                                                                                         |
    | deploy_kernel        | UUID (from Glance) of the deployment kernel. Required.                                                      |
    | deploy_ramdisk       | UUID (from Glance) of the ramdisk that is mounted at boot time. Required.                                   |
    +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add \
    driver_info/ipmi_username=$USER \
    driver_info/ipmi_password=$PASS \
    driver_info/ipmi_address=$ADDRESS

   .. note::
      If IPMI is running on a port other than 623 (the default). The port must
      be added to ``driver_info`` by specifying the ``ipmi_port`` value.
      Example::

       ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add driver_info/ipmi_port=$PORT_NUMBER

      Note that you may also specify all ``driver_info`` parameters during
      ``node-create`` by passing the **-i** option multiple times.

#. Update the node's properties to match the bare metal flavor you created
   earlier::

    ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add \
    properties/cpus=$CPU \
    properties/memory_mb=$RAM_MB \
    properties/local_gb=$DISK_GB \
    properties/cpu_arch=$ARCH

   As above, these can also be specified at node creation by passing the **-p**
   option to ``node-create`` multiple times.

#. If you wish to perform more advanced scheduling of the instances based on
   hardware capabilities, you may add metadata to each node that will be
   exposed to the nova scheduler (see: `ComputeCapabilitiesFilter`_).  A full
   explanation of this is outside of the scope of this document. It can be done
   through the special ``capabilities`` member of node properties::

    ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add \
    properties/capabilities=key1:val1,key2:val2

#. As mentioned in the :ref:`flavor-creation` section, if using the Kilo or later
   release of Bare Metal service, you should specify a deploy kernel and
   ramdisk which correspond to the node's driver, for example::

    ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add \
    driver_info/deploy_kernel=$DEPLOY_VMLINUZ_UUID \
    driver_info/deploy_ramdisk=$DEPLOY_INITRD_UUID

#. You must also inform Bare Metal service of the network interface cards which
   are part of the node by creating a port with each NIC's MAC address.
   These MAC addresses are passed to the Networking service during instance
   provisioning and used to configure the network appropriately::

    ironic port-create -n $NODE_UUID -a $MAC_ADDRESS

#. To check if Bare Metal service has the minimum information necessary for
   a node's driver to function, you may ``validate`` it::

    ironic node-validate $NODE_UUID

    +------------+--------+--------+
    | Interface  | Result | Reason |
    +------------+--------+--------+
    | console    | True   |        |
    | deploy     | True   |        |
    | management | True   |        |
    | power      | True   |        |
    +------------+--------+--------+

   If the node fails validation, each driver will return information as to why
   it failed::

    ironic node-validate $NODE_UUID

    +------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Interface  | Result | Reason                                                                                                                              |
    +------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | console    | None   | not supported                                                                                                                       |
    | deploy     | False  | Cannot validate iSCSI deploy. Some parameters were missing in node's instance_info. Missing are: ['root_gb', 'image_source']        |
    | management | False  | Missing the following IPMI credentials in node's driver_info: ['ipmi_address'].                                                     |
    | power      | False  | Missing the following IPMI credentials in node's driver_info: ['ipmi_address'].                                                     |
    +------------+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

#. If using API version 1.11 or above, the node was created in the ``enroll``
   provision state. In order for the node to be available for deploying a
   workload (for example, by the Compute service), it needs to be in the
   ``available`` provision state. To do this, it must be moved into the
   ``manageable`` state and then moved into the ``available`` state. The
   `API version 1.11 and above`_ section describes the commands for this.

.. _ComputeCapabilitiesFilter: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/devref/filter_scheduler.html?highlight=computecapabilitiesfilter


Enrolling a node
----------------
In the Liberty cycle, starting with API version 1.11, the Bare Metal service
added a new initial provision state of ``enroll`` to its state machine.

Existing automation tooling that use an API version lower than 1.11 are not
affected, since the initial provision state is still ``available``.
However, using API version 1.11 or above may break existing automation tooling
with respect to node creation.

The default API version used by (the most recent) python-ironicclient is 1.9.

The examples below set the API version for each command. To set the
API version for all commands, you can set the environment variable
``IRONIC_API_VERSION``.

API version 1.10 and below
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example of creating a node with API version 1.10. After creation,
the node will be in the ``available`` provision state.
Other API versions below 1.10 may be substituted in place of 1.10.

Beginning with API version 1.11, the initial provision state for newly created
nodes is ``enroll``. In the examples below, other API versions above 1.11 may be
substituted in place of 1.11.

In order for nodes to be available for deploying workloads on them, nodes
must be in the ``available`` provision state. To do this, nodes
created with API version 1.11 and above must be moved from the ``enroll`` state
to the ``manageable`` state and then to the ``available`` state.

To move a node to a different provision state, use the
``node-set-provision-state`` command.

.. note:: Since it is an asynchronous call, the response for
          ``ironic node-set-provision-state`` will not indicate whether the
          transition succeeded or not. You can check the status of the
          operation via ``ironic node-show``. If it was successful,
          ``provision_state`` will be in the desired state. If it failed,
          there will be information in the node's ``last_error``.

After creating a node and before moving it from its initial provision state of
``enroll``, basic power and port information needs to be configured on the node.
The Bare Metal service needs this information because it verifies that it is
capable of controlling the node when transitioning the node from ``enroll`` to
``manageable`` state.

To move a node from ``enroll`` to ``manageable`` provision state::

    ironic --ironic-api-version 1.11 node-set-provision-state $NODE_UUID manage

When a node is moved from the ``manageable`` to ``available`` provision
state, the node will go through automated cleaning if configured to do so (see
:ref:`configure-cleaning`).

Logical names
-------------
Beginning with the Kilo release a Node may also be referred to by a
logical name as well as its UUID. Names can be assigned either when
creating the node by adding the ``-n`` option to the ``node-create`` command or
by updating an existing node with the ``node-update`` command.

Node names must be unique, and conform to:

- rfc952_
- rfc1123_
- wiki_hostname_

The node is named 'example' in the following examples:
::

    ironic node-create -d agent_ipmitool -n example

or::

    ironic node-update $NODE_UUID add name=example


Once assigned a logical name, a node can then be referred to by name or
UUID interchangeably.
::

    ironic node-create -d agent_ipmitool -n example
