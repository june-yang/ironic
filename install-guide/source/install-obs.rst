Install and configure for openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
============================================================

This section describes how to install and configure the Bare Metal service
for openSUSE Leap 42.1 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1.

.. note::
   Installation of the Bare Metal service on openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise
   Server is not officially supported. Nevertheless, installation should be
   possible by following the general steps from another operating system, such
   as :ref:`Red Hat Enterprise Linux <install-rdo>`. The instructions might
   need adjustments, especially around package manager instructions and system
   paths.
